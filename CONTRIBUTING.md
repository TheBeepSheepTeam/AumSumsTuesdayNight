# More Information on Contributing to Alley Engine

## Branches
`stable` is the repository's main branch, so people can clone a stable Alley Engine to work on their mods. However, this means that Pull Requests will default to merge into
`stable` instead of `master`.

### If your pull request changes the engine, it merges into MASTER.
### If your pull request changes the website, it merges into STABLE.

This really took this long to document. Why?
